      This website was created by me, a music teacher, in response to the simple
      need to find a way to feature our students' work in light of the COVID-19
      pandemic. Our students' concerts have been cancelled, their rehearsals
      ceased, and their opportunities to share music diminished to a whisper of
      what they once were.

      As an upper elementary general music teacher, a big part of my COVID
      curriculum has been the{" "}
      <a href="https://musiclab.chromeexperiments.com/">Chrome Music Lab.</a>{" "}
      Students love making creations with it; it's fun and easy to use, and it
      provides an amazing platform for us to discuss the topics in our music
      curriculum. For me, the music lab has been an indispensable tool for
      coping with our school closure.

      <strong>This website</strong> is a simple way to share your students' work
      with your whole community. I know that I have been awestruck by the
      creativity of many of the music lab compositions that my students have
      shared with me, and I am sure that you feel the same.

      We need a beautiful, simple, and easy way to share these compositions with
      as many people as possible!
