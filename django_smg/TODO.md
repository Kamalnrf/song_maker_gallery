- [x] Fix slow loading time after galley creation
  - After gallery creation, the gallery is rendered and returned. This is
    slow because forcing a render makes the backend reach out to the google API
    unnecessarily.
  - Either:
    - Do not force a render after gallery creation
    - Give the user a loading spinner showing that the backend is working
      and everything will be ok
- [x] Optimize extremely slow re-rendering in gallery on screen size change
      by only re-rendering the component if the width crosses the threshold.
