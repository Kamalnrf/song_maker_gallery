# Share This Anywhere and Everywhere!

Hi all! I am really excited to share this awesome quarentine project / hopefully helpful
website made by a music teacher!

Here it is! [https://songmakergallery.com/](https://songmakergallery.com/)

This website is an extension of the popular and much-beloved Google Chrome
Music Lab. I personally love using the music lab in a wide variety of ways in
my own lessons, but at the end of the day all you are left to show for
students' creative output is a spreadsheet full of URLs. With the song
maker gallery, you can upload the links to your students' work and the website
will automatically create a beautiful, interactive, and ad-free online gallery
where you can share your students compositions with their peers and your school
community!

Best of all, this project is 100% free to use and open source. Feel free to
check it out on github if you are interested in contributing, or just want
to suggest a new feature
([https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery](https://github.com/jdevries3133/song_maker_gallery)).
