# Version 1.0 pre-release

This is a restoration of a previous version of the site before I implemented
docker and started to integrate the dynamic midi rendering tile. I am going
to develop this up into a "version 1.0" release to get ready for another
presentation soon for the Christmas holiday seasion.

# Welcome to the Music Lab Song Maker Gallery!

This website was created by me, a music teacher, in response to the simple
need to find a way to feature our students' work in light of the COVID-19
pandemic. Our students' concerts have been cancelled, their rehearsals ceased,
and their opportunities to share music diminished to a whisper of what they
once 
were.

As a third, fourth, and fifth grade elementary general music teacher, a big
part of my COVID curriculum has been the Chrome Music Lab. Students love
making creations with it; it's fun and easy to use, and it provides an amazing
platform for us to discuss the topics in our music curriculum. For me, the
music lab has been an indispensable tool for coping with our school closure.

This website is a simple way to share your students' work with your whole
community. I know that I have been awestruck by the creativity of many of the
music lab compositions that my students have shared with me, and I am sure
that you feel the same.

## We need a beautiful, simple, and easy way to share these compositions with as many people as possible!
